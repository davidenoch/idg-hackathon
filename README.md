# IDG Hackathon

This repository is a collection of code and data used in conjunction with my [Flipside's Studio analysis](https://flipsidecrypto.xyz/potmo/idg-hackathon-LI4-KA) for submission into Flipside's "Catalyst Hackathon". We are tasked with creating an analysis of blockchain data, using Flipside's "Intelligence-driven growth" framework and methodology. 

While the vast majority of data, code and visualizations are done from within Flipside's free "Studio" (a combination of a SQL sandbox with an array of curated tables representing blockchain data for a large subset of the most significant blockchains and protocols in web3, query/ collections filesystem and dashboard builder), those aspects which aren't available using SQL alone – some of the APIs require repeated calls to an API due to page size restrictions and we also access some Python libraries, led by [Scikit-learn's](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/) machine learning package.

Using Flipside's "Live query" feature, we access the data generated using Python with the `udf_api` function. These live in the `Data` directory. We also include all Python and SQL code used in this project. It is unnecessary for visitors to [my dashboard](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/) to visit this site as all the presentation materials will be contained within the Dashboard. It is intended that judges and reviewers can view and review that dashboard as a stand-alone submission. With that said, it is my hope that analysts will consider adding a programming language such as Python to be part of their arsenal. To this end, I am publishing the [HEX version of the dashboard]().

[HEX](https://hex.tech/) is a powerful all purpose coding/ publishing platform built on top of one of the data analyst/ scientist's favorite tools – the Jupyter notebook.
